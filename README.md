# Implement-A-Matrix-Class
In this project I have implemented a matrix class in Python. Specifically, I have implemented the following methods


class Matrix:
  def determinant(self):
      # your code

  def trace(self):
      # your code

  def inverse(self):
      # your code

  def transpose(self):
     # your code

  # Overloaded operators

  def __add__(self,other):
    # your code

  def __sub__(self,other):
    # your code

  def __mul__(self,other):
    # your code
